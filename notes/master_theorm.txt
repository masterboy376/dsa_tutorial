Recurrence relation: is an equation that recursively defines a sequence. for eg: F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2)
Master Theorm: gives time complexity for the recurrence relation T(n) = aT(n/b) + O(n)
- There are 3 cases
1. if f(n) = O(n^c), where c < log(a)base(b) then t(n) = O(n^(log(a)base(b))
2. if f(n) = O(n^c), where c = log(a)base(b) then t(n) = O((n^c)(log(n)base(e))
3. if f(n) = O(n^c), where c > log(a)base(b) then t(n) = O(f(n))
